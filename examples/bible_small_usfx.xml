      <v id="1">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</v>
      <v id="2">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</v>
      <v id="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</v>
      <v id="4">And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</v>
      <v id="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</v>
    </c>
    <c id="2">
      <v id="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</v>
      <v id="2">And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</v>
      <v id="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</v>

      <v id="1">Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</v>
      <v id="2">But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</v>
